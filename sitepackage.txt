The location of my site is dependent on which content management software I end up using (which I am hoping totalk to you about at some point today.) My issue is that for my site, it seems like overkill for me to set up a CMS since the content is limited to the ten or so web pages that I will produce, and is fairly static in nature. If I can create the site myself using HTML, javascript, and CSS, then I can host the site on parse.com and would be able to secure the domain phillybucketlist.parseapp.com. If you would like me to use a CMS, I will probably be hosting the site somewhere on the server space related to that CMS. The content that I am planning to launch the site with is still in creation (as I finish items on my list). I completed about three items last weekend so I have plenty to work with at the moment, and I'm also going for a playful/illustrated theme, so I am continuing to create graphic elements to go along with the photographic documentation. The page for each bucket list item will be it's own design, but they will be tied together by the style in which they are executed. I don't plan on adding too much interactivity to this site as of now, so I don't think I will be using any plugin scripts. If I can build the site myself I'd probably add some small interactions like hover/click effects with the illustrations using javascript. My main question as of now is whether or not it would be ok for me to build this site from the bottom up. I know you said in class that you would like us to use a CMS, but I am having trouble seeing what the benefit of that would be for this particular project. Hopefully we can talk about it at some point today!
